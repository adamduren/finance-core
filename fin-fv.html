<!--
A headless element for calculating the future values of investments. Example:

    <fin-fv
      rate="0.049"
      nper="60"
      payment="460.77"
      value="{{futureValue}}"></fin-fv>

    <b>Future Value</b> <span>[[futureValue]]</span>

The expected usage of this element is setting the properties described below
and binding an element in your UI to the `value` property to be notified of
calculation changes.

@group Financial
@element fin-fv
